## Grocery List Application Assignment

This assignment focuses on creating a grocery list organizer tool that allows users to track items they need to buy at the grocery store.

### Requirements

1. **Create Input and Button for Adding Food**

     - A dropdown menu for category (e.g. "produce", "dairy", "meat")
   - Modify the "Add Item" button to include all this information in the list
   - Display all information separated by commas in the list item

4. **Add Checkboxes for Items**
   - Add a checkbox at the beginning of each item in the list
   - Allow users to check items to indicate they've been purchased

5. **Track Items Left to Buy**
   - Display a count of the total number of items still left to buy
   - Update this count when items are added or checked/unchecked
   - Initially, this count should be zero when no items are in the list
   - Increase by one for each item added
   - Decrease by one for each item checked as bought

6. **Add "Check All" Button**
   - Create a button to check/uncheck all items in the list

   - Update the total count of items left to buy accordingly

7. **Add "Clear Bought Items" Button**
   - Create a button to remove all checked items from the list
   - Update the total count of items left to buy accordingly

8. **Calculate Total Price per Item**

9. **Style Items Based on Price**
   - Apply different text colors to items based on their total price:
     - Total price > $15: red text
